# Airbnb Clone Project (ProDev Frontend Program)

This project is a simplified Airbnb clone built as a case study for the ProDev frontend development program.  It aims to provide practical experience in building a booking and management system using modern frontend technologies.

## Project Goals

* Develop a functional booking system with a user-friendly interface.
* Implement core features: property listing, detailed views, checkout, and search.
* Gain experience with React, TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.
* Practice state management, API integration, and testing.

## Tech Stack

* **React with TypeScript:**  For building user interfaces with type safety.
* **Next.js:** For server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing.
* **Tailwind CSS:**  For utility-first CSS styling.
* **Redux/Context API:** For state management.
* **REST API:** For data fetching and integration.
* **Jest:** For testing components and logic.


## UI/UX Design Planning

The design of this Airbnb clone prioritizes a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly experience. The goal is to make browsing, searching, and booking properties as seamless as possible.

**Key Features:**

* Responsive design for various devices.
* Clear and concise property information.
* High-quality images and visual appeal.
* Streamlined booking process.
* Robust search functionality.



| Page | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Property Listing View | This is the main interface of the AirBnB clone. It shows a clean and modern layout with various property listings displayed, each with a title, price, and a brief description. The design focuses on user-friendly navigation and visual appeal. | 
| Listing Detailed View | This page illustrates a detailed view of a specific property listing within the AirBnB clone. It highlights key features such as the property’s name, location, price, and additional details like amenities. The interface emphasizes clarity and ease of use for potential renters.	 |
| Simple Checkout View | This page showcases the booking or reservation process for the selected property in the AirBnB clone. It may include options for selecting dates, the number of guests, and finalizing the booking. The design is streamlined to ensure a smooth user experience. |

**Importance of User-friendly Design:**
A user-friendly design is crucial for a booking system.  A well-designed interface encourages user engagement, reduces friction during the booking process, and ultimately leads to higher conversion rates.  A positive user experience builds trust and encourages repeat bookings.

**Colors:**
 * primary color = #34967C
 * Secondary color = #FFA800
 * black = #161117
 * shimmer = #F9F9F9

**Typography:**
    *Font family*
* Quicksand
* Source Sans Pro

**Importance of Identifying Design Properties of a Mockup:**

Identifying design properties in a mockup is essential for translating the design into functional code.  It helps developers understand the styling, layout, spacing, typography, and interactive elements, ensuring that the final implementation accurately reflects the intended design.  This attention to detail leads to a consistent and polished user interface.
